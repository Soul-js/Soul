# Soul

> Javascript runtime 

Soul is a Javascript runtime built for making _powerful_, and modern Javascript.

Here is a sample:

``` javascript
println("Hello, world!");
```

And when you run it through the soul compiler, it will display:

```
Hello, world!
```

It rewrites and changes Javascript as you know it, and transforms it into much more modern Javascript.

# Installation

You can't currently install it currently, but when it is released, it will only be availble on mac, but there will be executable files for other platforms that you will have to move to your bin your self

# Usage

> How the heck do I use _Soul_ after I install it?

To use soul, you can use the `-h` command, or to run a simple script, run `soul run myFile.js`
